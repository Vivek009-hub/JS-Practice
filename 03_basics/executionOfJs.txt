// VIDEO 25  ( Execution Context and Call Stack)


Javascript Execution Context

1. Global Execution Context ( this )
2. Function Execution Context
3. Eval Execution Context


Phases -> 
-> memory creation Phase
-> Execution Phase



Example:- 
let val1=10
let val2=5
function addNum(num1,num2){
    let total = num1+num2
    return total
}
let result1=addNum(val1,val2)
let result2 = addNum(10,2)


// Now we will understand Execution flow of JS code
1. Global Execution
         ⬇
       this(firstly GE is allocated in this)
2. Memory Phase( creation Phase)
    val1 -> undefined
    val2 -> undefined
    addNum -> definition(poori function ki definition store hogi)
    result1 -> undefined
    result2 -> undefined

3. Execution Phase
   val1 <- 10
   val2 <- 5
   addNum -> it will create its own new Execution Context( new variable environment + Execution thread )
